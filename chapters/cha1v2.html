                 <ge1>August 1st, 2008, 9 PM, in the Tokyo suburbs. It’s summer break. I, Shishido Michio, am lying in the bed of my apartment. 

As I lie there, facing my back to my body pillow and seven waifu figures, the wind blows through my open window.  

The girls shown by these figures and this pillow are my own. They’re not from anime or whatever, and I’m the only one that really knows about them. 

I paid someone to design them with the description and personalities I gave, and I paid someone else to make the figures and body pillow. 

I’ve spent way too much money… but I don’t regret it. 

I hear a noise from behind me. 

DON! 

I turn around to see my waifu figures have fallen off the shelf as I sigh. 
Then, I noticed Kirarise Suzu, my body pillow waifu, with her eyes moving.  

What the actual fuck? Am I hallucinating? 

As I was wondering what the hell was going on, Kirarise and my seven waifu figures started glowing, as they got bigger and bigger until they were life-sized. 

SHEEN 

I see 8 waifus lying with me on my bed, as my eyes go wide and my mouth hangs open. 

“W-W-W-What???” 

I stumble out of my bed and fall into my chair as the 8 waifus stare at me. “W-W-What is this???”  

Sitting there in shock, I felt unimaginable things. What was going on? Have my body pillow and figures really transformed into the waifus they were portraying? 

I look at each of them. Koyama Maki, Arizumi Ayako, Ryotose Yasuko, Izomi Kaoru, Kanenako Chika, Amasuki Kazue, and Kirarise Suzu.  

Koyama then spoke up. “Hi, Michio-me.” 

What? What is this? These girls are actually talking? And she just called me by my name? Is this a dream or something??? 

What the fuck is going on with my life… 

“Hi…”  

Koyama and the 6 other waifus got up from my bed and started walking around my room, examining it. 

Koyama stared at the lewd poster of her I had plastered on my wall. “Is this supposed to be me?” 

I blush as I struggle to maintain my composure. “Uh… yeah…” 

Koyama sighs and walks over to a wall to lean on it, making sure to not lean on the posters. 

As I stand there, I feel Amasuki’s piercing glare.  
“Michio-me, you’re a fucking pig. I know what  
you’ve been doing to us. Sniffing us, touching our privates, and using us as your toys.” 
I blush harder. Oh shit, I bet they all know what I’ve been doing to them.  

Kirarise runs up to me and hugs me.  

“I don’t care if you’ve done that stuff to those girls! You’re so sweet for hugging me every night!” 

What??? First, my figures and body pillow became actual girls, and now, my body pillow waifu is hugging me??? 

“Uh…” 

Kirarise giggles and hugs me tighter. 

“I love how you snuggle with me so often! I love you, Shishido!” 

DON! 

I hear that sound in my head as I’m about to explode from Kirarise’s words. This hot and cute waifu loves me, and she called me by my first name??? 

I catch Koyama in the corner of my eye, with a hint of jealousy on her face. There’s no fucking way she likes me too, is there? 

I look around the room as Kirarise continues to hug me. I see Koyama leaning against the wall pouting and Arizumi and Ryotose arguing about something.  

I look around some more and I see that Izomi, Kanenako, and Amasuki have gotten ahold of my phone. What are they doing with it? 

Kirarise hugs me even tighter. “Uh, you’re kinda crushing me…” 

She lets go. “Sorry, I just love you so much! Hehehehe~” 

Ryotose glares at me. “I’m with Amasuki. You’re a pig, Michio-me.” 

I feel bad about sniffing and touching the waifus when they were figures. And now they’re in real life, and they hate me…  

WOOSH 

The wind blows, as I walk to close the window. Kirarise looks like she’s about to say something, but she doesn’t. I see Koyama and Ryotose looking at me with a hateful gaze, as Ryotose looks at me with her smug smirk. 

Koyama walks up to me and bonks me on the head.  

DON! 

“You’re an idiot, Michio-me.” 

“What?”
