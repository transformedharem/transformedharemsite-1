<f1>August 1st, 2008, 9 PM, in the Tokyo suburbs. It’s summer break. I, Shishido Michio, am lying in the bed of my apartment.<br> As I lie there, facing my back to my body pillow and seven waifu figures, the wind blows through my open window. <br> The girls shown by these figures and this pillow are my own. They’re not from anime or whatever, and I’m the only one that really knows about them.<br> I paid someone to design them with the description and personalities I gave, and I paid someone else to make the figures and body pillow.<br> I’ve spent way too much money… but I don’t regret it.<br> I hear a noise from behind me.<br> DON!<br> I turn around to see my waifu figures have fallen off the shelf as I sigh.<br> Then, I noticed Kirarise Suzu, my body pillow waifu, with her eyes moving. <br> What the actual fuck? Am I hallucinating?<br> As I was wondering what the hell was going on, Kirarise and my seven waifu figures started glowing, as they got bigger and bigger until they were life-sized.<br> SHEEN<br> I see 8 waifus lying with me on my bed, as my eyes go wide and my mouth hangs open.<br> “W-W-W-What???”<br> I stumble out of my bed and fall into my chair as the 8 waifus stare at me. “W-W-What is this???” <br> Sitting there in shock, I felt unimaginable things. What was going on? Have my body pillow and figures really transformed into the waifus they were portraying?<br> I look at each of them. Koyama Maki, Arizumi Ayako, Ryotose Yasuko, Izomi Kaoru, Kanenako Chika, Amasuki Kazue, and Kirarise Suzu. <br> Koyama then spoke up. “Hi, Michio-me.”<br> What? What is this? These girls are actually talking? And she just called me by my name? Is this a dream or something???<br> What the fuck is going on with my life…<br> “Hi…” <br> Koyama and the 6 other waifus got up from my bed and started walking around my room, examining it.<br> Koyama stared at the lewd poster of her I had plastered on my wall. “Is this supposed to be me?”<br> I blush as I struggle to maintain my composure. “Uh… yeah…”<br> Koyama sighs and walks over to a wall to lean on it, making sure to not lean on the posters.<br> As I stand there, I feel Amasuki’s piercing glare. <br> “Michio-me, you’re a fucking pig. I know what <br> you’ve been doing to us. Sniffing us, touching our privates, and using us as your toys.”<br> I blush harder. Oh shit, I bet they all know what I’ve been doing to them. <br> Kirarise runs up to me and hugs me. <br> “I don’t care if you’ve done that stuff to those girls! You’re so sweet for hugging me every night!”<br> What??? First, my figures and body pillow became actual girls, and now, my body pillow waifu is hugging me???<br> “Uh…”<br> Kirarise giggles and hugs me tighter.<br> “I love how you snuggle with me so often! I love you, Shishido!”<br> DON!<br> I hear that sound in my head as I’m about to explode from Kirarise’s words. This hot and cute waifu loves me, and she called me by my first name???<br> I catch Koyama in the corner of my eye, with a hint of jealousy on her face. There’s no fucking way she likes me too, is there?<br> I look around the room as Kirarise continues to hug me. I see Koyama leaning against the wall pouting and Arizumi and Ryotose arguing about something. <br> I look around some more and I see that Izomi, Kanenako, and Amasuki have gotten ahold of my phone. What are they doing with it?<br> Kirarise hugs me even tighter. “Uh, you’re kinda crushing me…”<br> She lets go. “Sorry, I just love you so much! Hehehehe~”<br> Ryotose glares at me. “I’m with Amasuki. You’re a pig, Michio-me.”<br> I feel bad about sniffing and touching the waifus when they were figures. And now they’re in real life, and they hate me… <br> WOOSH<br> The wind blows, as I walk to close the window. Kirarise looks like she’s about to say something, but she doesn’t. I see Koyama and Ryotose looking at me with a hateful gaze, as Ryotose looks at me with her smug smirk.<br> Koyama walks up to me and bonks me on the head. <br> DON!<br> “You’re an idiot, Michio-me.”<br> “What?”<br></f1>
