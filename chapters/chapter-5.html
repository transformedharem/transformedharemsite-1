Chapter 5<br>
I’ve made my decision… looks like I’m spending my day with my waifus.<br>
<br>
SQUEEZE<br>
<br>
Kirarise is hugging me tighter…<br>
<br>
“Just spend the rest of the day in bed with me…”<br>
<br>
“My phone’s all the way on my desk… I gotta get out and call my boss.”<br>
<br>
Kirarise sighs and lets go.<br>
<br>
“Okay, but make it quick…”<br>
<br>
I crawl out of the bed, being careful to not knock one of the seven waifus as I trudge over to my desk.<br>
<br>
I turn on my phone and dial my boss’s number.<br>
<br>
RING RING<br>
<br>
“Yes? What is it? I am still having breakfast. What do you want? It better not be another excuse to stay at home.” An oily voice answers.<br>
<br>
“Sir, I… well. Uh, you see my uh… My wa– I mean my dog just died today. I have to go to her funeral. It’s a tradition among our family to care for our pets after they have passed to the afterlife.”<br>
<br>
“NO. YOU ARE COMING TO WORK TODAY. NOW! IF YOU’RE NOT AT WORK IN 1 HOUR, YOU ARE FIRED.” <br>
<br>
While I listen to that oily voice, my blood starts to boil.<br>
<br>
“Sir, but my dog…” I ask, calmly.<br>
<br>
“SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH UP! I DON’T GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT YOUR STUPID DOG!” <br>
<br>
My anger reaches a breaking point as I grip my phone tightly in my hands.<br>
<br>
SQUEEZE<br>
<br>
“WELL, I QUIT!”<br>
<br>
I hang up and slam my phone on my desk.<br>
<br>
DON<br>
<br>
As I fume with fury and rage, Ryotose puts her hand on my shoulder. <br>
<br>
“Looks like you’re staying home with us, Michio-me~”<br>
<br>
I sigh and look over to all seven of my waifus.<br>
<br>
“I guess I am…”<br>
<br>
Kirarise walks up to me with a smile and hugs me again.<br>
<br>
“Oh, master…”<br>
<br>
GULP<br>
<br>
Oh man… Kirarise’s really clingy…<br>
<br>
Koyama is leaning against the wall with a scowl on her face.<br>
<br>
“W-Why is she even hugging you? You’re not even warm, idiot!”<br>
<br>
I smirk as Kirarise continues hugging me. Koyoma’s such a tsundere… I should have some fun with her.<br>
<br>
I break off Kirarise’s hug and walk over to Koyama with a mischievous smirk on my face.<br>
<br>
“If I’m not warm, then why did you sleep with me last night?”<br>
<br>
The other 6 waifus start snickering, as Koyama starts blushing.<br>
<br>
“I-I-I-It was j-just because I d-didn’t want to sleep on the couch!”<br>
<br>
I lean in close and smirk even more.<br>
<br>
“Really?”<br>
<br>
Koyama blushes so hard that she turns into a tomato.<br>
<br>
“I-I-I-I… Yes! Really!”<br>
<br>
The other six waifus snicker even more as I lean back.<br>
<br>
“Okay then. Well, I’m going out with my friends. I’ll see all of you girls later.”<br>
<br>
I grab my phone and stride out of the room with a smirk. I’m so confident right now…<br>
<br>
11 hours and 30 minutes pass. 6 PM.<br>
<br>
I walk back into my house through the front door, and Kirarise immediately runs up and gives me a big hug as I blush.<br>
<br>
“I missed you so much, master!”<br>
<br>
I sigh and give her some headpats as I break off the hug.<br>
<br>
“I-I missed you too, Kirarise…”<br>
<br>
As I walk around the house to check out what the other girls are doing, Kirarise clings to my arm and giggles.<br>
I see Arizumi staring at me and smiling as I walk up to her.<br>
<br>
“Hey, Arizumi…”<br>
<br>
I blush at how pretty she is. God… I have all these waifus to myself…<br>
<br>
Arizumi smiles.<br>
<br>
“Hi, Shishido! Did you have fun?”<br>
<br>
I nod.<br>
<br>
“Mhm.”<br>
<br>
As I do this, Kirarise gives me a kiss on the cheek and walks off while giggling. I’m really red right now…<br>
<br>
Arizumi gets in close.<br>
<br>
“Shishio, I love you~”<br>
<br>
“W-W-What? You l-love me?”<br>
<br>
She nods and smiles more.<br>
<br>
“Mhm! Kirarise and I really really love you!”<br>
<br>
I back away in shock.<br>
<br>
“I-I’m going to my room!”<br>
<br>
I burst into my room and my face fills with shock.<br>
<br>
Ryotose inserts her tongue into Koyama’s mouth as they both lock into a deep and intimate kiss. They break apart shortly after, a strand of saliva connecting both of their lips.<br>
<br>
What…<br>
