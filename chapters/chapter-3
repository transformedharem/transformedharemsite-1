Chapter 3<br>
9:30 PM. So much shit happened in these past 30 minutes… where are these waifus gonna sleep? Don’t tell me… they’re gonna sleep with me???<br>
<br>
BA-DUM BA-DUM<br>
<br>
And when they brush their teeth, they’re gonna use my toothbrush???<br>
<br>
DOOM<br>
<br>
I muster what little strength I have left and speak up.<br>
<br>
“Um… girls… it’s getting late, and we should sleep…”<br>
<br>
Kirarise turns to me. <br>
<br>
“Sleep? Can I sleep with you?”<br>
<br>
GULP<br>
<br>
Oh shit… this hot waifu wants to sleep with me… oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit… should I let her???<br>
<br>
Arizumi runs up to me and grabs my hand.<br>
<br>
“If Kirarise gets to sleep with you, then I want to too!”<br>
<br>
I am dumbfounded. 2 hot waifus want to sleep with me???<br>
<br>
“I-I… I don’t think my bed can fit 3 people…”<br>
<br>
Izomi walks over to the bed and looks at it.<br>
<br>
“I think we can fit multiple people if we put our minds to it. I wanna sleep with Michio-me too, but I might roll off the bed…”<br>
<br>
Kanenako has a look of deep thought on her face.<br>
<br>
“Is it even worth having all of us on this tiny bed? I can’t even imagine how hot and sweaty it would be…”<br>
<br>
That’s right… if we do get everyone on the bed, that’s 8 people… 8 people in my small bed in my small bedroom… oh shit oh shit oh shit… <br>
<br>
Wait. They’re real people. They gotta eat, drink, pee, poop, shower… oh shit oh shit oh shit! Looks like my house is gonna be real busy from now on…<br>
<br>
Amasuki glares at me. <br>
<br>
“Why the hell do you girls wanna sleep with Michio-me? You’re all fucked in the head! He’s a total pig!”<br>
<br>
Kirarise stomps over to Amasuki and grabs her by the scruff of her neck.<br>
<br>
“DON’T TALK CRAP ABOUT MASTER!”<br>
<br>
Oh shit… now there’s infighting in between the waifus… jeez, why did they have to come to life??? Oh wait, this might be entertaining. Amasuki starts sweating…<br>
<br>
“H-Hey, calm down!”<br>
<br>
Kirarise gets angrier.<br>
<br>
“I’M NOT GONNA CALM DOWN, BECAUSE YOU WERE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT MASTER!”<br>
<br>
Izomi heads out.<br>
<br>
“I’m gonna talk to Koyoma and Ryotose…”<br>
<br>
Then Kanenako leaves.<br>
<br>
“I’m gonna explore the house…”<br>
Now it’s just me, an angry Kirarise, Amasuki, and Arizumi in my small bedroom at 9:40 PM…<br>
<br>
Arizumi holds my hand as she hides behind me.<br>
<br>
BA-DUM BA-DUM<br>
<br>
I’m holding a girl’s hand???<br>
<br>
And it’s not just any girl, it’s fucking Arizumi Ayako!<br>
<br>
I might just faint… but no! Not in front of these hot girls! Calm down… calm down…<br>
<br>
ba-dum ba-dum<br>
<br>
ba-dum… ba-dum…<br>
<br>
Good, I’m calm, unlike Amasuki…<br>
<br>
Amasuki starts panicking a bit.<br>
<br>
“Chill, chill! I won’t say it again!”<br>
<br>
Kirarise slowly lets go of her.<br>
<br>
“Never disrespect Master! Never ever! Master is mine!”<br>
<br>
Wait… she said I’m hers??? Oh shit… she really loves me??? And Arizumi said she loved me too, right??? Wait… Kirarise says I’m hers, but Arizumi loves me too… oh no…<br>
<br>
Amasuki sighs from relief. <br>
<br>
“M-Michio-me, I’m using your toothbrush… we all have to…”<br>
<br>
I better buy them toothbrushes soon…<br>
