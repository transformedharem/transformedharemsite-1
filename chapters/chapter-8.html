Chapter 8<br>

My eyes go wide and I look at Ryotose, my mouth agape.<br>
<br>
“K-K-K-Koyama???”<br>
<br>
Her eyes go wide.<br>
<br>
“Y-Y-Y-Y-You… you… what are you d-doing with her? She… her mouth… she’s sucking your dick… did you have sex?”<br>
<br>
Ryotose stops sucking my dick and looks at Koyama with a smug grin on her face.<br>
<br>
“Yes. We had sex, me and Shishido~”<br>
<br>
Koyama blushes even more.<br>
<br>
“I-I-I-I… I… I… gah!”<br>
<br>
She runs out the room and slams the door. Ryotose grabs my dick and smirks.<br>
<br>
“Shall we continue, Shishido?”<br>
<br>
Should I? Should I continue fucking Ryotose and letting her give me a blowjob? Koyama… is she gonna tell the other girls? What’s gonna happen? This is quite the situation… I sigh and answer her.<br>
<br>
“Ryotose… I don’t know if we should.”<br>
<br>
Her grip on my dick tightens as she leans in close, a seductive glint in her blue eyes.<br>
<br>
“Oh, Shishido, I think we should~”<br>
<br>
I’m not going to give into her toying.<br>
<br>
“No, Ryotose, we are not continuing. Now put your clothes back on.”<br>
<br>
I stand up and start putting my clothes back on. She gets up and sighs as she does the same.<br>
<br>
“Jeez, fine. That was fun though. Later~”<br>
<br>
She walks out of the room and closes the door. I hear her talking with the other girls. I sit down on my chair and let out a heavy sigh.<br>
<br>
“I just lost my virginity to a waifu figure that came to life…”<br>
<br>
A couple minutes pass. Then Koyama walks in and closes the door.<br>
<br>
“Michio-me… we need to talk… about that.”<br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
Why? Why does she wanna talk about it? I’ll just accept and see where this goes…<br>
<br>
“Sure, um… yeah, we can talk.”<br>
<br>
She sits on my bed and crosses her legs and looks at me, with a blush on her face.<br>
<br>
“Y-You… you can’t just have sex with her! You just can’t!”<br>
<br>
What? Is she mad? She can’t tell me what to do… I sigh.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Yes I can. Since when did you have this authority over me? Why can’t I have sex with her? We both consented to it.”<br>
<br>
Her face flushes even more.<br>
<br>
“I-I-I… y-you… you just can’t, okay???”<br>
<br>
God, she’s really not good at this…<br>
<br>
“And why can’t I? I can make decisions by myself, y’know. Are you mad that I didn’t fuck you? Are you mad that I lost my virginity to Ryotose and not you?”<br>
<br>
She blushes so hard that she turns into a tomato as her eyes go wide.<br>
<br>
“W-W-W-W-What??? No! I-It’s n-n-not l-like that, i-i-idiot!!! S-Stupid!!!”<br>
<br>
It is like that. She’s so fucking obvious that it’s funny. She really is a tsundere…<br>
<br>
“Oh? If it’s not like that, then what is it like? What’s the problem with Ryotose and I having sex?”<br>
<br>
She stammers as her face turns even more red, if that’s possible.<br>
<br>
“I-I-I-I…. t-that’s… I… I… it… i-it… it just i-is, okay???”<br>
<br>
She gets up, huffs, and storms out of my room, slamming the door as she does so.<br>
<br>
I sigh and lean back in my chair.<br>
<br>
“What the fuck is going on with my life…"<br>
