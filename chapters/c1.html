	<p  class='no-italics' ><br><br>August 1st, 2008, 9 PM, in the Tokyo suburbs. It’s summer break. I, Shishido Michio, am lying in the bed of my apartment.
<br><break>
<br>As I lie there, facing my back to my body pillow and seven waifu figures, the wind blows through my open window.
<br>
<br>The girls shown by these figures and this pillow are my own. They’re not from anime or whatever, and I’m the only one that really knows about them.
<br>
<br>I paid someone to design them with the description and personalities I gave, and I paid someone else to make the figures and body pillow.
<br>
<br>I’ve spent way too much money… but I don’t regret it.
<br>
<br>I hear a noise from behind me.
<br>
<br>DON!
<br>
<br>I turn around to see my waifu figures have fallen off the shelf as I sigh.
<br>Then, I noticed Kirarise Suzu, my body pillow waifu, with her eyes moving.
<br>
<br>What the actual fuck? Am I hallucinating?
<br>
<br>As I was wondering what the hell was going on, Kirarise and my seven waifu figures started glowing, as they got bigger and bigger until they were life-sized.
<br>
<br>SHEEN
<br>
<br>I see 8 waifus lying with me on my bed, as my eyes go wide and my mouth hangs open.
<br>
<br>“W-W-W-What???”
<br>
<br>I stumble out of my bed and fall into my chair as the 8 waifus stare at me. “W-W-What is this???”
<br>
<br>Sitting there in shock, I felt unimaginable things. What was going on? Have my body pillow and figures really transformed into the waifus they were portraying?
<br>
<br>I look at each of them. Koyama Maki, Arizumi Ayako, Ryotose Yasuko, Izomi Kaoru, Kanenako Chika, Amasuki Kazue, and Kirarise Suzu.
<br>
<br>Koyama then spoke up. “Hi, Michio-me.”
<br>
<br>What? What is this? These girls are actually talking? And she just called me by my name? Is this a dream or something???
<br>
<br>What the fuck is going on with my life…
<br>
<br>“Hi…”
<br>
<br>Koyama and the 6 other waifus got up from my bed and started walking around my room, examining it.
<br>
<br>Koyama stared at the lewd poster of her I had plastered on my wall. “Is this supposed to be me?”
<br>
<br>I blush as I struggle to maintain my composure. “Uh… yeah…”
<br>
<br>Koyama sighs and walks over to a wall to lean on it, making sure to not lean on the posters.
<br>
<br>As I stand there, I feel Amasuki’s piercing glare.
<br>“Michio-me, you’re a fucking pig. I know what
<br>you’ve been doing to us. Sniffing us, touching our privates, and using us as your toys.”
<br>I blush harder. Oh shit, I bet they all know what I’ve been doing to them.
<br>
<br>Kirarise runs up to me and hugs me.
<br>
<br>“I don’t care if you’ve done that stuff to those girls! You’re so sweet for hugging me every night!”
<br>
<br>What??? First, my figures and body pillow became actual girls, and now, my body pillow waifu is hugging me???
<br>
<br>“Uh…”
<br>
<br>Kirarise giggles and hugs me tighter.
<br>
<br>“I love how you snuggle with me so often! I love you, Shishido!”
<br>
<br>DON!
<br>
<br>I hear that sound in my head as I’m about to explode from Kirarise’s words. This hot and cute waifu loves me, and she called me by my first name???
<br>
<br>I catch Koyama in the corner of my eye, with a hint of jealousy on her face. There’s no fucking way she likes me too, is there?
<br>
<br>I look around the room as Kirarise continues to hug me. I see Koyama leaning against the wall pouting and Arizumi and Ryotose arguing about something.
<br>
<br>I look around some more and I see that Izomi, Kanenako, and Amasuki have gotten ahold of my phone. What are they doing with it?
<br>
<br>Kirarise hugs me even tighter. “Uh, you’re kinda crushing me…”
<br>
<br>She lets go. “Sorry, I just love you so much! Hehehehe~”
<br>
<br>Ryotose glares at me. “I’m with Amasuki. You’re a pig, Michio-me.”
<br>
<br>I feel bad about sniffing and touching the waifus when they were figures. And now they’re in real life, and they hate me…
<br>
<br>WOOSH
<br>
<br>The wind blows, as I walk to close the window. Kirarise looks like she’s about to say something, but she doesn’t. I see Koyama and Ryotose looking at me with a hateful gaze, as Ryotose looks at me with her smug smirk.
<br>
<br>Koyama walks up to me and bonks me on the head.
<br>
<br>DON!
<br>
<br>“You’re an idiot, Michio-me.”
<br>
<br>“What?”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
